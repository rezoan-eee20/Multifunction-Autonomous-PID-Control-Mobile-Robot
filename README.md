# Multifunction-PID-Control-Autonomous-Mobile-Robot

â€¢	Developed the robot to precisely follow a black/white line or a cave/wall with the automatic calibration of sensors and to take any necessary sharp turns smoothly; improved the robot to detect the color of an object (self-made color sensor RGB) and to avoid obstacles on its path to return to its normal path; implemented PID algorithm for accurate control with embedded C++ language on ARM-based microcontroller.
